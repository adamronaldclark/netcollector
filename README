NETCOLLECTOR listens on network interfaces for network discovery traffic (such as ARP and IPv6 Neighbor Solicitation) and builds a known host table from this traffic alerting you to new devices on your network. See important notes about NETCOLLECTOR below.

- Written for python 2. Not tested with python 3.

- Tested on Ubuntu 16 and CentOS 7. No other distributions tested.

- Run script with "python netcollector.py" using root/sudo privileges.

- The directory that netcollector is run from must be writable so the hosts and log files can be created.

- tcpdump must be installed on the system running netcollector for the scapy sniff() filter to work.

- This script is written to use a local version of scapy as an import. An uncompressed version of scapy must exist in the imports folder and match the version in the sys.path.insert() function.
